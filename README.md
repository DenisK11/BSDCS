# Traffic Intersection Control with Petri Nets

This project focuses on designing and simulating the control system for two traffic intersections using **Petri Nets**. The system manages traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, and incorporates traffic jam detection mechanisms to optimize flow and safety. The primary objectives are:

- **Traffic Light Control**: Implementing controllers for dynamic traffic light sequencing to ensure smooth vehicular flow.
- **Pedestrian Crossings**: Coordinating pedestrian signals with vehicle traffic to prioritize safety.
- **Traffic Jam Detection**: Identifying and responding to congestion to prevent gridlocks and improve efficiency.

The project uses Petri Nets as the core modeling tool for system representation, providing a clear, modular, and scalable framework for traffic management. Simulation and testing validate the effectiveness of the control system under varying traffic conditions.
